# Structure

This introduction is structured into three parts

1. Introduction to Tensorflow 
	* Explanation on what Tensorflow is and who uses it
	* How you would build a simple regression with Tensorflow
	* Writing a basic Image classifier with Keras
2. Deploying a Flask App in the Cloud and making it accessible to third-parties 
	* Products of the Cloud and explaining the industry shift towards it
	* Auto-ML and the ML APIs
	* Deploying a Python script as a Flask App with Google App Engine
3. Starting-points to move towards Data Science with a non-technical background 
	* Resources to get started
	* Getting a first Job in data sciences




## Overview of the Scripts presented

The course includes 5 short scripts which will be discussed. Scripts one through four also exist as notebooks. The Flask app is only available as a script as it cant be run in a Notebook environment

**TF-basics**: Basic operations in tensorflow and explains basic concepts such as a tensorflow session.

**Basic-Regression**: An example of what a linear regression would look like using the classic Iris Dataset

**Image-Classifier**: How to create a small image classifier trained on images of cats and dogs and save/load the weights of a network

**GCP-APIs**: Demonstration of the Google Cloud Platform Language API

**Flask-App.py**:  How to create a small Flask app that contains a neural network and deploy it as a webapp
